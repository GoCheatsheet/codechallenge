# Code Challenge

Code challenge solutions from different sources in Golang by @codeanit.
I do this because I want to improve my problem solving skills and keep my competitive edge.


### How to become at code challenges?
Know the process: `To solve the challenge, start with trivial, slow ideas and and improve towards creative, fast algorithms.` So just solve as you can first even the exponential solution if it works it's fine, be greatful.

Understand the basics, basic maths, data structures and algorithms. Don't skip maths. The data structures are the tools and the algorithms are the techniques that are the arsenal that every good programmer must have, more the better. Else, you will only see `a hammer and a nail`.

Start solving easy problems, then medium, and finally the difficult ones. Try dirrefent and  many code challenge at multiple sites.

Learn from other's solution, compare, refactor and improve.

Last and most important, answer to yourself, `why was it done this way`, review, realize.
