Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very simple and popular technique for finding all the prime
numbers in the range from 2 to a given number n. The algorithm takes its name from the
process of sievingâ€”in a simple way we remove multiples of consecutive numbers.

In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient
algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given
limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite 
(i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting 
with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a given
prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from
that prime, with constant difference between them that is
equal to that prime. This is the sieve's key distinction
from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate
number for divisibility by each prime.
